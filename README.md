Automation excercise using Python Selenium.

Learning along the way . .still identifying best practice, optimized way of coding.

as of now:

Utulizing POM: (but)
  - Separating python file for the elements that is the same across the page. (example: Menu Navbar, Footer . . )
  - Still not sure if having a separate file for "Actions" is a good way.


Best practice: ?
  - There should be an explicit wait for elements that will have an interaction.
  - If possible, add a scroll to element that they will be visible.
